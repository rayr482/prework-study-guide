# Raymond's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was made to help coding bootcamp students access information on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript easily. I was motivated to create this webpage thanks to my desire to learn coding as well. Making this webpage allowed me to learn about all 4 of these topics and what mindset developers must have in order to succeed. This webpage will not only make this information more accessible and easier to understand for myself, but for all other bootcamp students that struggle to learn about these topics through a regular study guide.
